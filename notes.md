Some things to note:

Database: The container for all the data that we store

TABLE: A collection of related data held in the database

FIELD: The basic unit of data in TABLE

COLUMNS: Another name for FIELD

ROW: A single set of data containing all columns in the table

flat file database: stores all data in a single table
        this results in a lot of duplication and can make updates difficult

a VIEW is a selection of ROWS and COLUMNS, possible from more than one TABLE
